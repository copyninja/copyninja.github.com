><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After struggling arround with lot of editors finally i made up my mind to continue with my old favourite editor vim. I choose Python as my primary language along with C and C++. Coming to the point I know vim 7.0 has auto complete feature but it works only by looking at what is already there in current workspace (content you are editing or creating). After googling a bit I came across this link <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=850">Python Auto complete script for the vim</a>. But had some trouble in setting up the things quickly. So writing this blog to make any other who want to use vim as their primary editor. :)<br />1. From the above mentioned link please download the latest pydiction-x.x.zip wr x.x is version.<br />2. In you home folder create .vim folder (if it doesn't already exists create one) unzip the contents. You will get a directory named pydiction-x.x containing following files<br /><ol><li>python_pydiction.vim</li><li>complete_dict</li><li>pydiction.py</li></ol>python_pydiction.vim is vim script, you should move it to ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/ (again if directory doesn't exist create one ). This is the default location on *nix* systems where vim will be looking for the filtype plugin. <span style="color: red;">Note: Only move the .vim files to this directory</span><br /><span style="color: black;">complete-dict is python dictionary containing all python function names. pydiction.py is used to extend this dictionary.<br />Now you need to create a file .vimrc in your home folder (if such file doesn't exist already)and add the following lines to the beginning of the file<br /></span><br /><blockquote><span style="color: black;">" Enable file type plugins</span><br /><span style="color: black;">filetype plugin on</span><br /><span style="color: black;">let g:pydiction_location='/home/vasudev/.vim/pydiction-1.2/complete-dict'</span></blockquote><span style="color: black;">First line tells vim to use file type plug-ins from ~/.vim/after/ftplugin and second line tells the location of dictionary file. Note: You can place this file any where in your system. Just give a proper path :)<br />I'm still customizing the vim editor and will be writing all my customizations here soon so watch out folks ;)<br /></span><br /><br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img alt="" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=f1eda091-e0d1-8bf2-b4fe-8c0441fc2803" /></div></div>
