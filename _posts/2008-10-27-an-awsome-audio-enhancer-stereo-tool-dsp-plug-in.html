><div style="text-align: justify;">Your speaker's are not giving good quality out put? Want to get good effects hidden in each song? Then you should download this plug-in for Winamp like players this include these players <a href="http://www.winamp.com/">Winamp</a>, <a href="http://www.spacialaudio.com/">SAM Broadcaster</a>, <a href="http://www.djsoft.net/">RadioBOSS</a> and all those player which supports Winamp DSP plug-ins.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I came accross this when my sir gave me the link of the website of this tool. As its a free software I thought&nbsp; it might not be that good still I wanted to give it a try so downloaded it from this <a href="http://www.stereotool.com/download/">link</a>. Here you will see a screen shot of this tool just click on it to download the plug-in.</div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.stereotool.com/download/dsp_stereo_tool_installer.exe" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="284" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Pms4ehFPMfI/SQXpPNTMPqI/AAAAAAAAAZI/yup2L_p4CJ8/s320-R/st_95perc.gif" width="320" /><img /></a></div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.stereotool.com/download/dsp_stereo_tool_installer.exe">Direct Download Link</a></div><div style="text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Before I was using DFX Audio Enhancer which is rated as the best audio enhancer in google also a proprietary software. But after using Stereo Tool plug-in I found DFX is nothing compared to this free software. Ya there is some problem with clarity if you try to alter all the controls shown in above image at a time, I suggest try&nbsp; each controls individually to see their effects especially try increasing Post AMP and Pre Amps at top sound of the song will be boosted awesomely. Forgot to mention some&nbsp; of the&nbsp; features are trial&nbsp; what the website&nbsp; tells about the trial&nbsp; features is&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: left;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><blockquote>If these features are enabled on the free (non-registered) version, a message ('This sound is processed by Stereo Tool') is played once every 12 hours. This should not interfere with most non-commercial usage.</blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;So not a big problem rite?&nbsp; This plug-in is actually developed for the FM-Stations so registered version is for the FM Stations. And when you activate you can see a line telling that trial features activated in the header of the plug-in. When you launch Winamp the plug-in will be launched along with it if you don't want this to happen in the plug-in there is a option which says "open as a system tray icon on launch" just check this option and it will reside in your system tray when you open it. I also suggest you to play songs without selecting any presets(also play with presets you will notice the difference). <br /></div></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">This software is for Windows only but don't worry Linux is&nbsp; also having similar things one of them is Ardour Digital Audio Workstation check out this <a href="http://ardour.org/">link</a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Well folks I hope you people will also like the Stereo Tool. Try it and don't forget to leave your experience as a comment :)&nbsp;</div>
