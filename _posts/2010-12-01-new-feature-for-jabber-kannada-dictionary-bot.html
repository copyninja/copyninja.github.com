<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">After seeing a great response and feedback for <a href="http://vasudevkamath.blogspot.com/2010/11/jabber-dictionary-bot-for-kannada.html">Kannada Jabber dictionary bot project</a> I thought of adding few new features and fixing some issues reported by the users. Here is the changelog</div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">1. Bot was not replying for <b>Tiger</b> where as there was meaning for word <b>tiger</b> an issue reported by one of the user. I've fixed this issue and now bot is case insensitive.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">2. Bot was not providing all the meanings for some words for example for word <b>tiger </b>it was replying as ಪುಲಿ where as Kannada Wiktionary contained these meaning ಪುಲಿ, ಹುಲಿ, ವ್ಯಾಘ್ರ. This issue is fixed now bot gives all the meanings present in Kannada Wiktionary.</div><br />Thanks to Suma and Vivek Shankar for reporting these issues.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">Now for the new feature, many users had asked a way for adding meanings to word for undefined words. My friend <a href="http://aravindavk.in/">Aravinda</a> suggested me a way to do this, by letting user send the meaning to bot when bot replies no meaning found. So when bot doesn't find a meaning it replies to as show in below screenshot.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Pms4ehFPMfI/TPW--FhGjZI/AAAAAAAABac/b75Nk_8qnHU/s1600/kn-new-reply.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="218" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Pms4ehFPMfI/TPW--FhGjZI/AAAAAAAABac/b75Nk_8qnHU/s400/kn-new-reply.png" width="400" /></a></div>&nbsp; <br /><br /><br /><br />So if you want to add the meaning to a word all you need to do is send the bot following line<br /><blockquote><i>#add&nbsp;</i><word><meaning(s)><i>word meaning(s)</i><br /></meaning(s)></word></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">If you have multiple meanings for a word please separate them with "<b>,</b>". We will collect all the meanings added by you and periodically send these to Wiktionary admins so they can verify these words and add them to Wiktionary. Please make use of this new feature and report back any bugs or any new suggestions :).. Also use the bot and help us to enrich the Kannada Wiktionary :).</div></div>
