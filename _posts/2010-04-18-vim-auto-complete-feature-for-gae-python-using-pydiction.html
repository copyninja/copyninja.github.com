><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In my one of the previous post on Vim auto-complete features, I used pydiction plugin to configure&nbsp; the Python auto-complete in vim. Same pydiction plugin comes with a handy python script called pydiction.py which allows you to add new module to the existing python auto-complete dictionary "complete-dict". <br /><a name='more'></a>For adding GAE to this auto-complete dictionary follow these steps.<br />1. Extract the google-appengine to say bin folder in your home directory. For eg .home/user/bin/google-appengine.<br />2. Now add a symbolic link to this folder in your python's site-packages directory which is found in /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages. You can use this command for the purpose but remember to change the version number of python appropriately.<br /><blockquote>cd /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages<br />sudo ln -s ~/bin/google-appengine/google<br /><br /></blockquote>3. Now go into the folder ~/.vim/pydiction1.x/ (if you followed my instruction to setup&nbsp; pydiction or wherever you have the complete-dict and pydiction.py) and run the following command<br /><blockquote>pydiction.py google<br />pydiction.py google.appengine<br />pydiction.py google.appengine.api</blockquote>As you encounter more module keep extending your dictionary set using pydiction.py. Note that pydiction.py backs up your complete-dict file each time you run it to a file complete-dict.last. So its better or shall I say its mandatory to have complete-dict and pydiction.py in same folder.<br />Thats all folks now you can program GAE with your vim without bothering to use memory hogging eclipse IDE. Enjoy !!! :)<br /><br />Vasudev<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img alt="" class="zemanta-pixie-img" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=c8b1d1ff-83dd-8bae-b2f7-c455b7661af0" /></div></div>
