Well this is just an introductory post to set of posts I'm going to
write down here on my blog. Idea is to improve the documentation of
CDBS but I still don't have any idea on how I can patch the existing
documentation, but in the mean time I'm learning new tricks from Jonas
which I want to document some where so I thought my blog would be a
good place as whole blog is in markdown format and its the same format
me and Jonas agreed to convert the existing CDBS documentation.

So this blog will act as a documentation and these post will be then
altered modified and put back into a proper CDBS documentation later.

I know many people don't like CDBS and most of it because there is no
proper documentation, so I'm trying to improve the situation so sit
back and enjoy the upcoming posts :-).
