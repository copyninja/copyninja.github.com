><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">We have started the Hejje program at TERI Auditorium Dommlur. Omshivaprakash is now introducing the Sanchaya. He is explaining why Sanchaya is created. Before creating Sanchaya there have been many efforts to popularize Linux and Kannada like Linux Habba, Linuxayana and Translation efforts but everything was decentralized effort and end result was nothing. So Sanchaya is formed to centralize all the efforts and people. Sanchaya came into picture with "Arivina AlegaLu" an Kannada E-magazine of technical article written in Kannada which was published on August 15th 2011. During creation of this magazine a lot of problems are encountered in Kannada fonts and that made Aravinda to improve Kedage and Malige fonts and create new fonts for Kannada called Gubbi and Navilu. The whole event will be&nbsp; having many talks and is divided into 2 parts morning session and 2nd session will be in the afternoon</div></div>
