After thinking a while I thought I should record my weekly FLOSS work and
I'm starting by this week. This week I'm on vacation and in home town so 
I could give bit more time for my FLOSS activity. So here it goes this weeks
work

Bug Squashing
-------------
<br/>
* Fixed a RC bug filed on Debian-IN team <strike>[687176](http://bugs.debian.org/687176)</strike>
  thanks to the timely patch from Kartik</li>
* Filed an *important* bug on fonts-taml which was missing a dependency on fonts-samyak-taml and
  fixed it myself :-) <strike>[687806](http://bugs.debian.org/687806)</strike></li>

Both these packages are uploaded to *unstable* first RC bug was related to Debian Installer hence was
unblocked before we could file unblock-request. Kartik filed an unblock-request and *adsb* unblocked
it happily and both the packages landed in unstable.

New Packages
------------
<br/>
* fonts-lohit-taml-classical is a new font for Tamil community developed by Lohit projects I don't
  know much about font itself but I cleared a wnpp bug with this package <strike>[681655](http://bugs.debian.org/681655)</strike>
* fonts-teluguvijayam is new package containing 3 Telugu fonts which is released by Department of
  Information and Technology Andhra Pradesh. This package is pending upload and will clear wnpp
  bug [669238](http://bugs.debian.org/669238) and is a pending upload.
* I finally cleared all review comments by jwilk on surf package and now 0.5 version of surf is in
  experimental.
  
Both these packages will be backported once Wheezy freezes. One pending wnpp is left on Debian-IN
which I've left for Kartik to finish ;-).

Font Package Helper
-------------------

I bumped version on *dh-make-font*[1] to 0.3 now it accepts upstream URL with -u, --upstream switch
this will be placed in Homepage: field of control file and in Source: field of copyright file. Probably
I need to think of introducing xz compression to original source tarball where upstream is not
giving any tarball and probably rewrite it using Perl so it can get included dh-make package. Already
a bug filed to get it included in dh-make package [658154](http://bugs.debian.org/658154).

Misc and Learnings
------------------
<br/>
* Helped Jonas to fix a minor issue in boxer. I still have to figure out one issue on boxer and
  add ramfs support to boxer. If you see boxer commit log you can find a few *Thanks to Vasudev Kamath*
  but I still didn't commit anything directly which is now in my TODO :-)
* Started learning Perl from *Moder Perl* [book](http://www.onyxneon.com/books/modern_perl/index.html) thanks
  to Jaldhar for pointing this book for me.
  
Well that is it for this week. Hopefully I will have new stuffs to put up here for the next week, till then Cya.
