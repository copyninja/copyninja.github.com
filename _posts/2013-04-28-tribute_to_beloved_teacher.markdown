Today I'm writing this blog with saddened heart. My mentor and a best
friend Dr.[Ashokkumar](https://twitter.com/ashok567) is no more. He
died yesterday after fighing with Lymph Node cancer.

*Ashokkumar* or *Ashok sir* that is how we all students used to
 address him, was a Professor in Information Science Engineering in
 NMAM Institue of Technology and recently transferred to Computer
 Science Engineering Departement. My last meeting him with him was
 last year December during which he was looking every bit okay other
 than he had knee pain because of which he couldn't walk freely. But I
 never imagined that it will be my last meeting with him.
 
 Ashok sir was also behind the FLOSS event that took place in NMAM
 Institute of Technology including MiniDebconf 2011 which saw 2 of the
 foreign DD's Christian Perrier and Jonas Smedegaard.
 
 It was because of his first organized FLOSS event which I volunteered
 called *Linux Habba* I entered into the FLOSS world. This means its
 because of him that I started my FLOSS world journey and reached to
 my current level. Also it was because of his motivation I started
 writing this blog which I continue till this day.
