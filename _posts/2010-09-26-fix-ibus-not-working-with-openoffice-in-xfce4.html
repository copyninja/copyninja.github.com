><div style="text-align: justify;">Today I faced a really weird problem of unable to type Kannada in OpenOffice Writer using iBus. I'm using Xfce4 with GDM in Debian and installed it recently. I was able write in Kannada in OpenOffice&nbsp; with KDE4 and KDM.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">After a small research igured out the issue was&nbsp; mainly because <i><b>openoffice.org-gnome</b></i> pacakge was not installed in my system where as in KDE environment with KDM had <i><b>openoffice.org-kde</b></i> installed.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;">Fix: If you are also facing this issue just check you have <i><b>openoffice.org-gnome (for gdm) and openoffice.org-kde (for kdm)</b></i> installed. After installing this packages you can start typing Kannada (or any other language) using iBus in OpenOffice.</div>
