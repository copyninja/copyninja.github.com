><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;">I recently created aspell-kn dictionary and thus I became author for atleast one upstream project ;).. In this tutorial I'm just going to summarize the steps involved in creating an aspell dictionary for a particular language (in my case Kannada).</div><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;First step is to get the latest source of aspell-lang from cvs. Yes aspell still uses cvs but we need the source only to get a map file for our language and belive it won't take much time even on slow connection (like mine) to checkout the source. Use following command to checkout the aspell-lang.</div><br /><blockquote><i>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.savannah.gnu.org:/sources/aspell co aspell-lang</i></blockquote><div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;The above command will create aspell-lang in the directory where you executed it. Now change to <i><b>aspell-lang/maps&nbsp; </b></i>directory. This directory contains language map files. Look for the map file for your language. If your language has Unicode charachter set the map file should <i>u-<lang>.txt</lang></i>. In my case the file was <i>u-knda.txt</i>. Open up the file in any editor and check if you need to add anything more than what is already in the file. This file actually maps 128-character Unicode space for the language to the space 128-255. Normally whatever content inside this file should be sufficient but for Indian scripts we require to map 2 Unicode control character <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZWJ">ZWJ</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZWNJ">ZWNJ</a> This is how u-knda.txt looks after addition of these 2 control characters<br /><br /><blockquote><i>0x11 = U+200C<br />0x12 = U+200D<br />0x80..0xFF = U+0C80..U+0CFF</i></blockquote>Next step is to generate the <i>cmap</i> and <i>cset</i> file for the language. Under aspell-lang directory there is a perl script "mkchardata"&nbsp; use this to generate <i>u-<lang>.cmap</lang></i> and <i>u-<lang>.cset. </lang></i>In my case I used following command to generate <i>u-knda.cmap</i> and <i>u-knda.cset</i><br /><blockquote><i>perl mkchardata maps/u-knda.txt</i></blockquote>&nbsp;Now create a working folder for new directory <i>aspell-<langcode></langcode></i> in my case <i>aspell-kn, </i>copy the u-<lang>.cmap and u-<lang>.cset to that directory .cmap and .cset is not mandatory file but I think if your language uses Unicode character set then these files are mandatory. Also create a <i>misc </i>and copy u-<lang>.txt in to this folder.</lang></lang></lang><br />Next we need to create <i>info </i>file. This file contains information about the dictionary. Below is the info file I used for aspell-kn<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/959314.js?file=info"></script><br />As you can see all fields are self explantory. One thing I would like to mention here is <i>data-file </i>field. If your language needs cset and cmap files then use this field to give their name.<br />Next you need to create <i>Copying</i> file describing the terms of dictionary usage. If you are using license other than standard license then licesne text should be placed in <i>COPYING </i>file. For GPL licences this file will be created during processing phase.<br />Next important file is <i><lang>.dat </lang></i>format of this file is described in aspell manual under chapter <i>"Adding support for new language" </i>[1]. Below is the <i>kn.dat</i> which I created.<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/959373.js?file=kn.dat"></script><br /><br />Now we have all the required files. Copy <i>proc</i> file from <i>aspell-lang</i> (cloned from cvs) to your working directory and run it as shown below<br /><blockquote><i>./proc create</i></blockquote>This will create <i>configure</i> script and <i>Makefile.pre</i> finally copy the word list file to working directory and name it as <i><lang>.wl</lang></i>. Word list file contains list of words seperated by new lines. Now run the following commands<br /><blockquote><i>./configure</i><br /><i>make</i></blockquote>This will convert the wl file to cwl (Compressed wordlist file using prezip tool). also creates a rws file. Now the dictionary is ready and to publish the dictionary to world use <i>make dist</i> this will create a tarball for distribution. Note that tarball doesn't include .wl file it only contains cwl file.<br /><br />I created aspell-kn refering to the tutorial on Indlinux wiki [2]. The only reason of rewriting the entire tutorial is I felt the tutorial given in Indlinux wiki is not suitable for beginer (I being the one during creation of aspell-kn had to struggle a lot to get everything together).<br /><br />The source for aspell-kn is available at [3] and source for the Kannada wordlist is available at [4] aspell-kn can be downloaded from [5] and will be soon packaged for Debian :) <br /><br />[1] http://aspell.net/man-html/Adding-Support-For-Other-Languages.html#Adding-Support-For-Other-Languages<br />[2] http://indlinux.org/wiki/index.php/IndicSpellchecker <br />[3] https://gitorious.org/indic-projects/aspell-kn<br />[4] https://gitorious.org/indic-projects/wordlist<br />[5] http://sanchaya.net/downloads/aspell-kn/</div></div>
