title: Moving out of Blogger

---

Its been a while I wanted to move out of Blogger. The reason for this
act was one I don't like rich text editor and second I can't login to
some website and then undergo pain of writing blog there. I want to write
everything in plain text and in emacs. I don't want even blogging clients.

Now coming to the point I was thinking what to use as my new client I tried
a few like *blosxom* *Pivotx* and even wanted to give try to *ikiwiki* but 
I couldn't get any of these work properly. I came across ***Jekyll*** from my
friend <a href="http://aravindavk.in" rel="nofollow">Aravinda</a>. So thought
I should give it a try. And here I'm typing this post in emacs and hosting my
website on github using github pages and jekyll.

I'm no website designer so I borrowed themes and templates for initial site from
[*mojombo*](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com), creator of Jekyll tool
and co-founder of Github. Some of the pages like Archives, and index page of blog
was taken from the <a href="http://julianyap.com">*Juliyen Yap* </a> and menu was
taken from *Aravinda's* website. After getting everything into place I modified stuff
to my taste and included some fonts from <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">*FontSquirrel*</a>.

So now my blog is almost ready with following TODO remaining
> Create **Projects and Talks** page <br/>
> Create tools to allow renaming of drafts in suitable format <br/>
> Migrate disquss comments from blogger to here <br/>
> Well write more blogs which are pending because of my lazyness :P <br/>

Well hope you will continue reading my blog here. Till next time Cya.
