<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: inherit;">I'm using Firefox 3.0.5 on WINDOWS XP and having a problem while accessing the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></span>. This problem started to me a week back whenever I launch some applications in facebook firefox will stop&nbsp; responding and only way left with me is to kill the process. This problem occurs only for facebook apps. First I thought it might be due to corrupt installation but same problem occured to my friend when he accessed facebook. Firefox is working fine with all other site only with facebook this problem is occuring. So my big question is is this a bug ? if not can you provide me a solution ;)</div>
