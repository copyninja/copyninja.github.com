In Week 21st of 2012 (i.e May 20th ) I got a chance to travel to Germany, country pioneering in
the Mechanical Engineering and Automobile Industry. I always get lazy after any event or travel to
write about it but this time I made up my mind that I would share my experience with my friends through
my blog. So here we go.

It was my first Air travel and first overseas travel and I was really tensed on what to do in Air port how
to go how to get through connecting flight and all bla bla. This is not first time I'm getting tensed like this,
this is a common symptom for me to undergo when I'm travelling this same sort of questions where there in my
mind when first time I came to Bangalore. So my journey started on 0030 IST 20th May 2012 from my friends house
from Nagavara. I had booked a KSTDC taxi and it came by 0015 to pick me up and I'm at *Bangalore International Airport*
at around 0050. I was looking at *BIA* for first time in my life and I was wonder stuck looking at the Airport.
The taxi driver helped me getting a trolley so I can carry my *check-in* and *cabin* baggage inside Airport. Ok here is the
funny part I did that is using trolley. Holding handle is like a break of trolley and I didn't know how to operate
it so instead of pushing down  the break and moving trolley I was trying to pull it up and push the trolley front
in other words I was putting break and trying to move the trolley :-D. Well the security Police understood my difficulty
and told me to push down the breaks and move forward and wala trolley moved very smoothly.

Next step was getting my *boarding pass* and going through *immigration* and *security check*. And it took a while probably
half an hour or 45 minutes and by 2'o clock or 230 in the morning I reached my assigned Gate which was just after security checking
thank god I didn't had to search a lot :-). I waited there till my boarding time which was at 4'o clock in the morning and
by 430 everybody was in Plane and it took after 5 or 10 more minutes waiting. View of Bangalore from sky was awesome
sadly I didn't had camera other than one in my Phone which I had to switch off during take off.

After take off Pilot welcomed everybody on board mentioned technical data like speed of wind outside temperature height
bla bla. He also mentioned breakfast will be served in some time!. Weird timing for me to have food in morning 5'o clock
Any way by the time breakfast came to me it was 530 I guess but still dark outside. I ate my breakfast I didn't knew what
it was I just ate and drank the Fruity sort of stuff I don't remember its name.
