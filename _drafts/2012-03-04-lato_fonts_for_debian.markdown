title: "Lato Fonts for Debian"
---

For giving new look to my blog I was trying out a lot of fonts from the
*[FontSquirrel](http://fontsquirrel.com) * website but none of them satisfied
my taste. While searching for the fonts *identi.ca* website fonts attracted
my notice and the font used was *Lato*. I found it and used in this website.

I was wondering why such a nice font is not present on Debian. Since it was on
*FontSquirrel* that means the license should be friendly. So searched for the font
in *DuckDuckGo* and found their [website](http://www.latofonts.com). So after all
*Lato* fonts where under *Open Font License* which is ***DFSG*** compilant. That
was sufficient for me to package it for Debian.

Here is the [ITP for fonts-lato](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=662111)
and its already uploaded to Debian and waiting in the [NewQueue](http://ftp-master.debian.org/new/fonts-lato_1.104-1.html)
Thanks to [bubulle](http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/bubulle) for uploading it quickly.

Hope Debian users will love this new font. And yeah I packaged it using *dh-make-font* which
I wrote majorly with help of my friends. And one more news is its waiting to be added into
*dh-make* package [here](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=658154).
