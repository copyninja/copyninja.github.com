><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;"><a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html">Objective – C </a>is a super set of C with messaging style of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk">Small Talk</a> programming languages. Objective C is backbone of Apple's operating system. Cocoa and Cocoa Touch API's which are used by Macintosh OS and iPhone OS. Even though you don't need to use Apple platform to learn Objective C, GNUStep which is clone of NeXTStep based on OpenStep standard allows programming with Objective C and Cocoa based API's on either Windows or Linux platform with GCC complier. But if you want to become a full fledged programmer with Cocoa API's you need to use Mac OS X operating system (and ofcourse their hardware ;) )<br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">Ok now to the point I was basically a programmer who worked on the Java, PHP and Python like dynamic and managed languages. But needs arised and I had to learn Objective C, as usual I learnt the basics of Objective C and started programming with Cocoa Touch API's (i.e iPhone). But within few days I learnt that Objective C is not like the languages which I've been using till now. Let me tell few things to keep in mind when moving from managed programming languages to a <strike>unmanged</strike> programming language like Objective – C(<b>Before version 2.0. 2.0 has introduced a optional garbage collector, but for iPhone OS there is no garbage collector</b>).<br /></div><a name='more'></a><ol><li><b>What is managed and unmanaged  languages? </b><br /><br /></li></ol><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Programming  languages like Java is called managed language because programmer is  relived of the memory management issues. To be clear programmer can  allocate objects and just forget about it after that. Why I'm  telling like this is there is Garbage collector which will be run by  JVM periodically which will release these objects.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">So  what are PHP and Pyhon like languages? Well these are also managed +  dynamic languages, meaning you don't have to declare a variable  before using them. System will decide their type during runtime.</span></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Comming  to unmanaged languages like Objective C (<b>Objective C 2.0 has introduced garbage collection though garbage collector is absent on iPhone OS</b>). These languages except  programmer to handle the memory management. Meaning its up to  programmer to release the objects that he has allocated before  program exits. Well this is were most of the managed language  programmer feel difficulty while transiting to Objective C. We are  always told in our engineering courses that you need to release what  you allocate but nobody took it seriously that time :) and nobody  told us the importance of releasing objects that time (guess  lecturers themselves were not nowing the reason ;) ). But belive me   when I started with Objective C I understood the reason. It is to  avoid memory leaks and it becomes serious issue when your program is  supI feel Objective C should be introduced as part of academics in  India since it makes students to learn basics of memory management  which is most important thing to know before becomming a  professional programmer. And Objective C is more OO than the  C++.  Concepts OOP will be more clear with Objective C than C++ but point  should be noted that some concepts of OOP like abstractions are not  included in Objective C but I feel abstraction is not required in  normal scenarios :). According to me evethough its unmanaged  language Objective C is still a beautiful language out there.posed  to run on limited memory devices like phones PDA's etc.</span></li></ul><ol start="2"><li><b>Memory Leaks what  are these? </b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Ok as I mentioned  in my last point in unmanaged languages not releasing the objects  which you allocate will lead to memory leaks. Let me try to define  it in my own terms :). OS allocates chunk of memory to the programs  and expects the programs to return it back when program is done. In  other words when you try to allocate  an object system gives a  memory reference to you (your program) and makes you (your program)  its owner. Owner here means once the memory reference is passed to  your program its management is upto your program including returning  it back to the OS. In other words if you fail to release what you  allocate that part of memory will not be touched by the OS even if  your program exits (untill and unless a hard reboot occurs) meaning  waste of resource and in small device ( also in normal computers )  this may lead to system crash.</span></li><li><b>Releasing what is  the big deal? </b><span style="font-weight: normal;">If you are  thinking like this I'll say think again :). This is another place  where the Java and other language programmer get trapped while  moving to Objective C. I know releasing is simple but keep in mind  if you release the object in wrong place you are in big trouble.  This normally happens in Objective C you release the objects  thinking its not of use any more but be sure before doing so why  because in case if you unknowingly refered to the same object again  your program crashes showing you EXEC_BAD_ACCESS and you wont even  know where this happened. You need to painful debugging to find out  and some times even debugging wont resolve the issue. Thanks to the  Apple for providing NSZombie and tools like Instruments, Shark and  Malloc Debug which will reduce the pain for certain extent but not  completely. In the sense it will give a clue on where thing is going  wrong andThis normally happens in Objective C you release the  objects thinking its not of use any more but be sure before doing so  why because in case if you unknowingly refered to the same object  again your program crashes showing you EXEC_BAD_ACCESS and you wont  even know where this happened. finding and fixing it is upto you.</span><br /></li><li><b>Some more points to be  remembered </b>  <br /><br /><br /><ul><li><span style="font-weight: normal;">As   I mentioned you should release only those objects of which you are   owner in the sense object created with init,alloc,retain etc. Never   try to release them or you will corrupt memory leading to a program   crash</span></li></ul><br /><br /></li></ol><ul><ul><li><span style="font-weight: normal;">If   you are not able to figure out why your program is crashing  use   NSZombie rather than still trying to debug the program.</span></li></ul></ul><ol start="2"></ol><ul><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Becareful   while using functions like mutableCopy you need to release the   object after the function or it will lead to a leak. i.e obj1 =   [[obj2 mutableCopy] autorelease]</span></li></ul></ul><ol start="2"></ol><ul><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">Use   property and synthesizers for the objects inside the class.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul></ul><ol start="2"></ol><div style="text-align: justify;">Well whatever points I mentioned here was my own personal experience. I never read the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/MemoryMgmt.html">Memory Management guide</a> from Apple but I suggest you folks to do it first. Since I had to learn things quickly I couldn't read it.  <b>And if I have told anything wrongly or there is something were I can improve my self please do comment. Your suggestions are precious for me :).</b><br /></div><div style="font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify;">I feel Objective C should be introduced as part of academics in India since it makes students to learn basics of memory management which is most important thing to know before becomming a professional programmer.

So pardon me for my mistake but Objective C still remains unmanaged on the iPhone OS platform </b><br /></div>
