><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>In my previous <a href="http://blog.copyninja.info/2011/12/my-journey-with-debian-and-floss-part-1.html">post</a> I told till I packaged fonts-pagul for which RFP was filed by Santhosh. Well after that Santhosh filed one more RFP to get Eeyek font which even though I claimed for Debian-IN but I couldn't complete till date :). Well reason is that I got new job and had to shift from my home town to Bangalore. In the mean time I did manage to get aspell-kn into Debian. Funny part is I'm the upstream author of this package and I myself maintain it in Debian too. aspell dictionary for Kannada was my first upstream project after SILPA and Pypdflib. </i></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>Well know while explaining my life with Debian I forgot about other projects which I had done :). Yes some where in between all these packages I ported the Malayalam dictionary bot written by Santhosh and other SMC members for Kannada.</i> <i>I added some more improvements to cache the meaning retrieved from Kannada wiktionary also I used to cache the words for which I couldn't find the meaning in wiktionary with a hope to contribute it to Kannada wiktionary people so that they can add these undefined words and make Kannada wiktionary rich. But that never happened I couldn't give enough time for Kannada wiktionary bot which still lies at <b>kn.dict.bot [at] jabber [dot] org</b> serving meanings to people. Did I forgot to tell you that this bot has become a UNIX daemon and is monitored by monit service found in Linux. So its not only a UNIX daemon but a real zombie try killing it by giving non-sense words or whatever bot will die and will be back in a while like a Phoenix coming back from its Ash :). Psst. one secret thing I came to know is how naughty people are :D what nonsense words they send to this bot poor bot he nicely logged their email address and words :) Don't worry my intention was to give credits for undefined words but my plan was totally ruined by these people :).</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>The response I got from people for creating this bot was tremendous. I was flattered and got some more energy and inspiration to do more for people for FLOSS community. So let me continue my story now. After moving to Bangalore for a month or 2 I was totally disconnected from FLOSS and mostly from Internet. The whole misunderstanding was from my side that I thought laptop which I'll get from my new office will be installed with Debian as I am supposed to be working on the Debian itself but yes I was wrong instead I got Wind</i>ows 7 <i>Enterprise. Sigh the OS which I hate most :(. I was not supposed to install anything other than official stuff but I did install Firefox because IE really sucks and hence with help of Chatzilla I used to get online in IRC and meet my buddies :). Did you think I got an internet connection ? No all ISP's denied me from Internet connection because I'm staying as a Paying Guest! Now I know why we say *Mera Bharat Mahan*.</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>After my first salary I managed to buy a cheap Acer Travelmate model which is Linux friendly. It came with Linpus Linux which I removed and installed Debian Wheezy and I also managed to get my HTC Wildfire USB Teathering to work with it and installed stuffs required to build Debian package. Do you think I'm 3G? Err nooo I use only 2G a broken connection from Vodafone I know how much pain I daily undergo in using it :(.</i> <i>I said cheap but note that its Cheap in cost but for me its one the best hardware and works like a charm with Debian (no non-free blobs required!). </i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>So from Bangalore I continued my FLOSS/Debian work and started working on restructuring ttf-indic-fonts package which I self assigned to myself. Bubulle had told me that I had opened up a can of worm and now after starting to work on the package I really understand what he meant :). Its still not midway in the transition we in team Debian-IN lack man power for the work and some time I feel I'm getting buried by the burden I'm carrying</i>. <i>But I still manage to crawl under all weight to reach my destination :).</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>During this time I had also taken additional responsibility of conducting the Mini DebConf in Mangalore area and I now being located in Bangalore had all sort of trouble communicating with my friends over in NMAMIT Nitte and in the period of time <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianIndia/MiniDebConf2011/MangaloreEdition">Mini DebConf Mangalore Edition</a> had become a International event which I never imagined it would become.</i> <i>In one way or other I got benefited by hosting the event I got 3 DD's to sign my PGP key which my path to become a DM easy. I don't want to explain the whole event of Mini Debconf because it would take its own space :).</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>After the event I applied for DM position my application can be found <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2011/11/msg00000.html">here.</a> Mine was the first application in the month of November and Kartik and Christian (bubulle) happily advocated me and I filed a bug report against debian-maintainer pseudo package by submitting a jetring changeset of my PGP key</i> <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=647914"><i>here</i></a>. <i>It took a while for my key to be included in debian-keyring and I officially became a Debian Maintainer on December 1 exactly one month after my application. Finally I achived one of my long term dream to become a Debian Maintainer :). Next I want to become a Debian Developer according to rules I need to wait 6 more months before I can apply to NM front desk :). Before that I want to upload my package to Debian by myself :) need to see how long it will take.</i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>In between my DM process I adopted dwm which was orphaned by its previous maintainer Kai Hendry. Its a very simple window manager which is younger brother of wmii. The whole reason to adopt was my long time dream to use window manager and love towards the <a href="http://suckless.org/">suckless project.&nbsp;</a></i></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><i>Well after becoming DM a week spent without any productivity and on 9th I started back to my home town on a week long vacation. Now writing this post from my home and working on the "can of worm which I opened"&nbsp; :) Well this is a longish post but I wanted to finish this post here. Don't worry I'll write more of the parts as and when I have more story :).. Till then so long folks. </i></div></div>
